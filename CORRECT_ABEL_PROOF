IT DOESNT MAKE SENSE TO RE-ORDER RELAXATIONS
what about:

1 2 3 [2 3] 4...
and we explain why [] doesnt matter

ASSUME WE RELAX THE [ITEMS] EVEN THOUGH THEYRE NOT SUPERCRITICAL
THE NUMBER OF GRAINS WONT CHANGE
WE WILL NEED THE TRIANGLE TO HAVE SUPERCRITICALITY FOR THE MAIN SEQUENCE
A SUPERCRITICALITY CANNOT OCCUR AT J AFTER A SINGLE RELAXATION AT J-1 IF Z_{j-1}=0
if 3 isnt supercritical when the main sequence gets interrupted, 

we need to show that if the normaol order is valid, the main sequence M must be supercritical after the premature relaxation of []

up until the FIRST occurence of n; inductive proof

1. the height h_n is independent on the order of relaxation of the indices up until the last occurence of n
2. therefore, if we first relax all the off-main sites up until the last occurence of n and then the main sites, n will be supercitical
3. the only relaxation that might make site n not supercritical is the relaxation at n
4. therefore, even if we first relax all the sites except the last occurences, site n will be supercritical when we relax all the main sequence elements before it (this holds for all n)


3 must be supercritical after the premature relaxation of [] for 4 to be supercritical if done properly, since the total configuration of heights is the same regardless of relaxation order QED
